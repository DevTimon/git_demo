Learn Git with EPAM
Can be really fun
Don't take it close
It's supposed to be joke

Let's start with GUI
Make yourself free

Now work with branch
It make essential sense
One more branch commit
Just to check work of it

Keep going to merge
It's way to learn

Make some conflicts
To understand git
What to do with changes?
What did you recommended?

One more little couplet
About how implemented tags
